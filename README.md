# LandingPage_OTP

CSS Foundations Final Project

For this project I’ll be creating an entire web page, only using HTML and CSS, from a design provided by The Odin Project course.

The design provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website (Desing.png), and the other one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used (Fonts&Colors.png).
